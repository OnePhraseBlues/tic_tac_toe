what are my objects?
  game board
    object will display the board
    it will not check for wins but it will check for a full board
  cells
    cells will only need to know what to display on the game board
    the logic for the win condition will be in the player objects

  players
    will check for win by storing the moves it made
    checking move legality will fall on the cells objects
  
  score board
  score cells

game progressions:
  win conditions:
    1, 2, 3
    4, 5, 6
    7, 8, 9
    1, 4, 7
    2, 5, 8
    3, 6, 9
    1, 5, 9
    3, 5, 7
  if all cells are filled and no winner, add a tie
  possibly check the player objects themselves, did you make a play on any of these three arrays?

ideas for user input:
  simply ask user which space to play 1-9
  throw errors for invalid inputs, using an occupied space, etc
  possibly add a first to 5 option?
